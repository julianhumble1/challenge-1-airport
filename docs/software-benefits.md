# **Airport Software Documentation**

### Aim & Benefits of this software

This software is being made to help control the flow of planes at the client's airport. It is to be used by the air traffic controllers, who will be able to instruct planes to land and take off, ensuring the maximum of 10 planes in the airport at any one time is maintained. This maximum can also be overrided.

The benefits of this software to the airport and traffic controllers include:
* Air Traffic Controllers will be able to stop any planes landing if the airport is full, which would cause a collision.
* Air Traffic Controllers will be able to manually change the maximum number of planes allowed, in the case of an airport upgrade or if there is a closure of a terminal for example.

### Potential Risks
* In the event that the software goes down / crashes, air traffic controllers need a backup system to avoid plane collision.
