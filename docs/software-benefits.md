# **Airport Software Documentation**

### Aim & Benefits of this software

This software is being made to help control the flow of planes at the client's airport. It is to be used by the air traffic controllers, who will be able to instruct planes to land and take off, ensuring the maximum of 10 planes in the airport at any one time is maintained. This maximum can also be overridden.

The aim for the introduction of this software is to reduce risk, expenses and help streamline and simplify work for the air traffic controllers.

The benefits of this software to the airport and traffic controllers include:
* **Reduced Danger** - Air Traffic Controllers will be able to stop any planes landing if the airport is full, which would cause a collision between a landing plane and an already landed aircraft. If there were to be a collision between planes, this has the potential to be very dangerous to anyone aboard the landing plane or even the plane already at the airport. Further damage could also be caused if the collision were to start a fire or ignite an explosion.
* **Reduced Expenses** - As well as the danger to life caused by any collisions described above, this would also be potentially very expensive to the airport and plane owners to replace and repair any damage to the aircraft and terminals.
* **Flexibility** - Air Traffic Controllers will be able to manually change the maximum number of planes allowed, in the case of an airport upgrade or if there is a closure of a terminal, for example. This will help to future-proof the airport and allow continuous use of the software throughout any physical changes to the airport.
* **Continuous Development** - If in the future additional functionality may need to be added to the software, this can easily be done to extend the usability beyond just these initial requirements.

### Potential Risks
* **Potential Crashes** - In the event that the software goes down / crashes, air traffic controllers need a backup system to avoid plane collision.
* **Software can fail** - Compared to a more physical / mechanical approach to accounting for the planes in the airport, the usage of software is reliant on the computers to work to prevent anything going wrong, which could cause an accident.
* **Effects on ATCs** - If the software is made to be highly automated and less reliant on the word of the ATCs, this could make the ATCs less focussed and possibly perform less well in their roles.
* **Requires knowledge of software backend to maintain** - Over time, there is a risk that the team who made the original software become less accessible and therefore the program becomes more difficult to upgrade or maintain.
